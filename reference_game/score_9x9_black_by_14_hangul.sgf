C[빨간색이 승 또는 패 입니까?


경기를 끝내시겠습니까?
















Black as won?  Do you see anything different between black and \
white's structure?
















Black has taken three corners.
White has only claimed one corner.
















Black also has a thin wall.
Whereas white as claimed one corner.

Corners are easier to claim, because you get two sides for free.]
